# ezShellGen

Displays reverse shells with provided IP, port and in the required language(if specified)

All payloads are from [PayloadsAllThings Reverse shell](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md)

Still need to add more reverse shells

Made to make getting reverse shells, for my convenience

Please do not use this/any commands from program with any malicious intent

Happy hacking <3
